üíª Web Development Internship Projects Overview
This repository features two distinct web development projects built during internships, demonstrating front-end design, user interaction, and dynamic content rendering using HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript, and popular UI/UX libraries such as GSAP and Swiper.js.

üî∑ Project 1: Tic-Tac-Toe Game
This project is a fully interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application features:

Grid-based UI layout built with HTML and styled with responsive CSS.

Smooth and visually clear game state updates using color-coded "X" and "O" symbols.

Functional game logic in JavaScript including:

Turn-based logic with X and O class toggling.

Winning combination detection via array logic.

Game end handling for both wins and draws.

Dynamic UI updates using textContent and CSS class changes.

A Restart button that resets the board and allows users to replay seamlessly.

The use of modern JavaScript practices like event delegation, modular functions, and DOM manipulation for clean and readable code.

Enhanced user experience with hover effects and visual feedback on cell interactions.

This project helped reinforce skills in DOM traversal, event-driven programming, and game state logic, and is ideal for understanding UI feedback cycles.

üå¥ Project 2: Responsive Travel Landing Page
This is a professional-grade Responsive Landing Page for a fictional travel agency, developed using HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JavaScript along with integrated libraries like:

Swiper.js: For creating touch-friendly, animated carousel sliders that showcase different island destinations with images, titles, and descriptions.

Boxicons: For adding modern vector icons to navigation and UI elements.

GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): For smooth scroll-based animations and hover effects (included but not fully used in this version).

Responsive Design:

Fully adaptable layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports.

Modern CSS Grid and Flexbox used for structured layout.

Interactive Features:

Navigation bar with a toggle menu for smaller screens.

Fullscreen popup embedded with a YouTube video to promote destinations.

Animated buttons and video icons for dynamic user interaction.

Auto-scrolling and thumbnail-controlled slider navigation using Swiper.js.

SCSS support (via styles.scss) for better CSS organization and scalability.

This project emphasizes UI/UX design principles, cross-device responsiveness, and the integration of third-party libraries into a cohesive and professional website structure.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Skills Used

üöÄ Purpose and Learning Outcome
These projects reflect practical application of core web development concepts and frontend tools learned during internship programs. They demonstrate the ability to:

Convert static design ideas into dynamic, interactive web apps.

Apply modern JavaScript logic to real-world use cases.

Use external libraries efficiently to improve UI/UX.

Write clean, maintainable code with scalable CSS using SCSS and component-based styling.
